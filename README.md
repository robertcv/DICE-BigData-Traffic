# BigData-Transport

This project is a real world example of how to use DICE tools. Its main
purpose is to collect, store and process transportation data in
Ljubljana.

The project contains:

* **collectors** – Set of python scripts which collect data from
different sources and foreword them to Apache Kafka.

* **virtual_machines** – Set of Vagrantfiles and bash scripts for
deploying VMs for testing purposes. Later those will be replaced with
blueprints.
