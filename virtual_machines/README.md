## Virtual machines

This folder contains Vagrantfiles and bash scripts for local testing.
 
For the example this project containse we need three components wich are
installed on diferent virtual machines. 

Those are :

* **Apache Kafka** - distributed streaming platform
* **Apache Cassandra** - distributed database management system
* **Apache Spark** - cluster-computing framework

In the future those virtual machines will be deployed with blueprints.
